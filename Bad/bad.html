        <p>Bandcamp as a concept represents to me one of the best entrepreneurial DIY music resources of this decade, but perhaps because I love them so much I hate their disappointing website. A jumble of newly uploaded or forcibly suggested songs crowds the home screen (none of which I have ever heard of nor care to hear), along with another panel containing the weekly Bandcamp suggestions. The limited amount of user interaction and personalization is startling, considering the aim of this site is to be a music purchasing platform where you would think custom tailored suggestions or personal purchases might be featured.</p>

        <p>Reddit is a strange example of how being too comfortable with a website's design can cause a major dysfunction down the road. Virtually no changes have been made to Reddit's user interface, and the results are a jumbled mess of disorganized links and articles. For a website that is so geared towards communication, it's website is pretty horrifying!</p>

        
        <h2 id="SpaceJam">Space Jam</h2>

        <p>Space Jam's website has remained untouched and floating in the great depths of internet space since 1996. It's a good reminder how far we've come and how far we can go in creating successful user interfaces over the course of 8 years. Links to movie features are sprawled across the site in a disorganized way, and lacks any enticing graphics.</p>
